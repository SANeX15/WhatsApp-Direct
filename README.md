# **WhatsApp Direct**

## Introduction
This application aids in messaging to unsaved contacts with the feature to add a preset message.

### Things to know before using application
 - For **Desktop Mode**, WhatsApp for Desktop needs to be opened before sending message.
 - For **Web Mode**, WhatsApp Web needs to be logged in before sending message.
 - Sometimes, the message doesn't input itself in the textbox in WhatsApp Desktop, so you may have to press the send button twice.
